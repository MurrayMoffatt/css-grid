# CSS Grid
Twelve column grid built with Flexbox.
##Features
* Three responsive breakpoints (small, medium and large)
* Optional gutters
* Helper classes to vertically align center and horizontally center
Originally created because I wanted the basics of what Bootstrap offers but I didn't need as many breakpoints.
